# Risk Assessment Feature Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the automatic risk assessment feature that triggers when a patient is added to the system. The feature provides immediate risk classification, cost estimation, and inventory status for each new patient.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Automatic Risk Assessment
- **Trigger**: When a patient is added via the Add Patient dialog
- **Process**: 
  - Patient data is sent to the Python backend
  - AI model calculates risk level (Low, Medium, High)
  - Risk factors are identified based on Kenyan guidelines
  - Cost estimation is automatically generated
  - Inventory status is checked

### 2. Risk Assessment Popup
- **Display**: Shows immediately after patient creation
- **Content**:
  - Risk level with color-coded indicators
  - List of identified risk factors
  - Cost estimation summary
  - Navigation button to detailed cost estimation

### 3. Cost Estimation Integration
- **Automatic Calculation**: Based on patient data and risk level
- **Financing Options**: Multiple payment plans and insurance options
- **Detailed View**: Full cost breakdown available via navigation

### 4. Inventory Status Enhancement
- **Non-Empty Arrays**: Ensured inventory never returns empty arrays
- **Default Items**: Fallback inventory items for each treatment type
- **Real-time Status**: Available, low stock, and out-of-stock items

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Patients Screen (`patients_screen.dart`)
- Modified `AddPatientDialog` to trigger risk assessment
- Added `_showRiskAssessmentPopup()` method
- Integrated cost estimation call
- Added navigation to cost estimation screen

#### 2. Cost Estimation Screen (`cost_estimation_screen.dart`)
- Updated to accept patient data as parameter
- Pre-fills form with patient information
- Enhanced display for CostEstimation objects
- Added financing options display

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Enhanced API Server (`enhanced_api_server.py`)
- Updated `get_real_time_inventory_status()` function
- Added fallback inventory items for each treatment type
- Ensured non-empty inventory arrays
- Maintained existing functionality

#### 2. Risk Assessment Endpoint
- Returns risk level (Low/Medium/High)
- Provides risk factors list
- Includes guidelines compliance information

#### 3. Cost Estimation Endpoint
- Calculates comprehensive cost breakdown
- Provides financing options
- Includes risk-adjusted pricing

## User Flow

1. **Add Patient**: User fills out patient information form
2. **Submit**: Form data is sent to backend for processing
3. **Risk Assessment**: AI model analyzes patient data
4. **Popup Display**: Risk assessment results shown in popup
5. **Cost Summary**: Estimated cost displayed in popup
6. **Detailed View**: Option to view full cost estimation
7. **Navigation**: Button to navigate to detailed cost page

## Risk Classification

### Low Risk
- Cyst size < 5cm
- CA-125 < 35 U/mL
- Pre-menopausal
- Simple cyst features

### Medium Risk
- Cyst size 5-8cm
- CA-125 35-200 U/mL
- Peri-menopausal
- Complex cyst features

### High Risk
- Cyst size > 8cm
- CA-125 > 200 U/mL
- Post-menopausal
- Solid mass features

## Cost Estimation Features

### Base Costs
- Consultation fees
- Diagnostic tests
- Treatment procedures
- Follow-up appointments

### Risk Adjustments
- Higher risk = higher cost multiplier
- Additional monitoring requirements
- Specialist consultation costs

### Financing Options
- NHIF coverage (80%)
- Private insurance (90%)
- Self-pay with discounts
- Installment plans

## Inventory Management

### Treatment-Specific Items
- **Surgery**: Surgical instruments, anesthesia supplies
- **Medication**: Pain relief, hormonal therapy
- **Observation**: Ultrasound gel, examination gloves
- **Referral**: Medical records, referral forms

### Fallback System
- Default inventory items for each treatment type
- General medical supplies always available
- Prevents empty inventory arrays

## Testing

### Test Script (`test_risk_assessment.py`)
- Tests risk assessment endpoint
- Tests cost estimation endpoint
- Tests inventory status endpoint
- Provides comprehensive validation

### Usage
```bash
python test_risk_assessment.py
```

## API Endpoints

### Risk Assessment
```
POST /risk-assessment
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "Age": 35,
  "Menopause Stage": "Pre-menopausal",
  "SI Cyst Size cm": 6.5,
  "Cyst Growth": 0.2,
  "fca 125 Level": 45,
  "Ultrasound Fe": "Complex cyst",
  "Reported Sym": "Pelvic pain, bloating"
}
```

### Cost Estimation
```
POST /cost-estimation
Content-Type: application/json

{
  // Same patient data as above
}
```

### Inventory Status
```
POST /inventory-status
Content-Type: application/json

{
  // Same patient data as above
}
```

## Error Handling

### Frontend
- Form validation for required fields
- Loading states during API calls
- Error messages for failed requests
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data

### Backend
- Input validation
- Model loading checks
- Exception handling
- Meaningful error messages

## Future Enhancements

1. **Risk History**: Track risk changes over time
2. **Treatment Recommendations**: AI-powered treatment suggestions
3. **Insurance Integration**: Real-time insurance verification
4. **Appointment Scheduling**: Automatic follow-up scheduling
5. **Patient Education**: Risk-specific educational materials

## Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- Update risk factors based on new guidelines
- Adjust cost calculations for inflation
- Refresh inventory data
- Monitor model performance

### Data Validation
- Validate patient data quality
- Check model prediction accuracy
- Verify cost estimation accuracy
- Ensure inventory data consistency

## Conclusion

The risk assessment feature provides immediate, comprehensive evaluation for each new patient, ensuring timely intervention and appropriate resource allocation. The integration with cost estimation and inventory management creates a complete patient management workflow.
